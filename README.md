Project: Rock Paper Scissors

An implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors game based on The Odin Project currriculum.

What I've learnt:
- How to implement and manipulate elements through the DOM (creating/removing elements, changing styles and text)
- Deeper understanding of the differences between elements and node lists in the DOM 
- Simple CSS transform and transition effects
